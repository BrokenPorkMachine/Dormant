Summary (non-binding)

You can build it. Modify it. Host it. Share it.
But you cannot turn it into spyware.
You cannot lock it up as a closed SaaS.
You cannot use the Dormant name while violating user privacy.

This license cleanly encodes the ethos of Dormant:

User keys stay local.
No invisible observers.
No proprietary capture.
